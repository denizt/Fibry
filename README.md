Fibry
==

Fibry is an experimental Actor System built to be simple and flexible to use. Hopefully it will also be fun to use.
Fibry is the the **first Java Actor System using fibers from [Project Loom](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/loom/)**.

Project Loom is an OpenJDK project that is expected to bring fibers (green threads) and continuations (co-routines) to Java.
Fibry also works from any version of Java **starting from Java 8**, but you will need to use Loom if you want to leverage the power of fibers.
Fibry aims to replicate some of the features of the Erlang Actor System in Java.
Fibry support of thread confinement allow you to send code to be execute in the thread/fiber of the actor.

Some numbers
==
So, fibers are better than threads. Got it. How much better?
Very much. Depending on your problem, you can consider them 10X-100X better than threads.
Please remember that Fibry is not optimized for performance, though performance have been taken into high consideration.
Also Loom is not completed yet, so its performance can change.
I would not call the following numbers real benchmarks, as they have not been taken in a properly configured system, but the difference between threads and fibers is so high that a pattern will clearly emerge. I used my development laptop for these measures.
I might do a better round of benchmark in the future, and disclose the characteristics of the system.

- Number of concurrent threads that can be created without OS tuning: around 10K
- Number of concurrent fibers that can be created: more than 3M (**300x better**)
- Threads created per second: 3.5K
- Fibers created per second: 130K (**37x better**)
- Sync messages per second, between 2 threads (requires thread switching): 8.5K
- Sync messages per second, between 2 threads (requires fiber switching): 64K (**7.5X better**)

As an indication, Fibry can send around 4-5M of messages per second

Simplicity first
==
*Fibry* has been designed to be simple:
- Your actor can and should use synchronous logic
- There is a series of Stereotypes to handle common scenarios
- You actors don't need to extend any particular class but just implement Consumer or Function
- Your actors can be used "transparently" in code that knows nothing about your actors, as the implement Consumer and Function
- It is simple to retrieve the result of a message
- There is a fluid interface
- You can receive messages of your choice while processing a message  
- You can send code to be executed in the thread/fiber of the actor (Chromium uses a similar mechanism)
- **Fibry has no dependencies**, so no conflicts, no surprises and just a tiny jar

Why fibers?
===
Fibers, or green threads, are lightweight threads. Lightweight means that you can have many of them, and in fact Fibry will be happy to keep running several million of fibers at the same time, if that's what you need.
With threads, depending on your configuration, you can maybe have some tens of thousands.

Surely you can use thread pools, but if you need to execute long operations this can be a problem, and in fact you might need to use asynchronous network operations to scale.
And **asynchronous code is hard**. It can be really hard. Even a simple logic can be split in several callbacks and create endless issues.
You can do amazing stuff with just a single thread, but you pay a price for it.

With fibers you can write your actors using synchronous calls. Yep, boring, plain, synchronous calls, and your project will still scale like crazy.
That's why **Fibry** was born: to let you write simple actors with synchronous logic.

Project Loom?
===
Yes, that's the trick. Project Loom enable fibers. While fibers are nice but themselves, they were not very useful to do network operations until JDK 13 (due in September 2019) merged [JEP 353](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/353), that rewrote part the network stack of Java to be Fiber friendly.
Unfortunately, Loom is not yet merged into the OpenJDK, so you will have to build it by yourself. This might sounds scaring, but it is not.
On Linux, building Loom is a matter of running a few commands and waiting:
```bash
hg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/loom/loom 
cd loom 
hg update -r fibers
sh configure  
make images
```

Please consider that to compile Loom you need a "bootstrap JDK" that should be Java 12 or 13 (I guess 14 also works as Looms is already on JDK 14). I used Zulu 12 for my tests.

More info in [Loom Wiki](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/loom/Main#Main-DownloadandBuildfromSource)
On Windows you might have to use a Virtual Machine, and I would recommend to avoid shared folders as they can be issues with symbolic links.

To recognize Loom you don't need to do anything particular, **Fibry will detect if fibers are available** and use them automatically. But you do have to choose to use the FIBER or AUTO strategy, as Fibry allows you to force the creation of threads, if that's what you need.

Creating actors with ActorSystem
===
While using actors is very simple, there are several ways to create the actors and to use them, so you will need to decide how you want your system to be built.

The most flexible way to create actors is using ActorSystem, a class implementing a fluid interface.
You might create anonymous and named actors, the difference being that named actors have a name and they can be used without having ac Actor object, and in fact you can send messages even before the actor has been created, which helps reducing race conditions.
You can choose the strategy: AUTO (the default, using fibers if available), FIBER (using fibers, throwing an exception if they are not available) and THREAD (using threads).
You can supply an initial state, which is mostly useful for thread confinement.

You can create 4 type of actor (ok, 6...):
- Normal Actors: they receive messages without returning any result; they need to implement Consumer or BiConsumer (if you need access to the actor)
- Returning Actors: they compute a result and return a CompletableFuture for each message; they need to implement Function or BiFunction  (if you need access to the actor)
- Receving actors: they are norman actor that can also "receive", meaning that they can ask the actor system to deliver some particular message while processing another message, e.g. if you are waiting for another actor to provide some information; they need to implement BiConsumer
- Receving and returning actors: the are receiving actors that can also return a result;     they need to implement BiFunction

Please take into consideration that while Receiving actors are the most powerful, there is some overhead in their use, and the receive operation must be use carefully as in the worst case it might have to scan all the message in the queue. In fact, I expect many cases to be covered with returning actors (e.g. you ask something to another actor and wait for the result), and they should be preferred.

Let's see now how to create ac actor:
```Java
Actor<Integer, Integer, Void> actor = ActorSystem.anonymous().newActorWithReturn(n -> n*n);
```

Using actors
===
Using actors is super simple. The main functions are **sendMessage()** and **sendMessageReturn()**. To get a result from the previous actor, we can do:
```java
actor.sendMessageReturn(2).get()
```

But actors also implement the **Consumer** and the **Function** interface, so the previous code can be rewritten like this:
```java
actor.apply(2).intValue()
```

Please notice that **apply()** is blocking and it is therefore equivalent to **sendMessageReturnWait()**, while sendMessageReturn() returns a CompletableFuture that can allow the code to do other things while waiting.
An eccessive use of apply() and sendMessageReturnWait() can have negative effects on performance.

Thread confinement
===
Actors systems exist to implement thread confinement: your thread/fiber executes in the same thread/fiber and therefore you don't need synchronization or thread-safe classes.
Usually the logic of the actor is supplied during the creation, but sometimes instead of implementing several message types it would be easier to just "send some code" to be executed in the context of the actor.
An example would be **Platform.runLater()** in JavaFX.
Fibry support this behavior for every actor, with the methods *execAsync()*, *execAndWait()* and *execFuture()*, all accepting Runnable and Consumer interface.  
 
Stereotypes
==
As you start to us actors, some patterns might emerge on the way that the actors are configured.
Some fo this patterns have been implemented in the Stereotypes class.
Please check it and feel free to send me suggestions for new stereotypes.
You are encouraged to use the **Stereotypes** class instead of relying on ActorSystem, if it provides something useful to you.

Some examples:
- *workersAsConsumerCreator()*: creates a master actor returned as Consumer; every call to **accept()** will spwan a new actor that will process the message, making multithread as simple as it can be 
- *workersAsFunctionCreator()*: as before, but it accepts a Function, so it can actually return a result
- *embeddedHttpServer*: creates and embedded HTTP Server (using the standard HTTP Server included in Java), that process any request with an acotr
- *sink()*: creates an actor that cannot process messages, but that can still be used for thread confinement, sending code to it
- *runOnce()*: creates an actor that executes some logic in a separated thread, once.
- *schedule()*: creates an actor that executes some logic in a separated thread, as many times as requested, as often as requested
- *tcpAcceptor()*: creates a master actor that will receive TCP connections, delegating the processing of each connection to a dedicated fiber. This is nice for IoI, to design a chat system or in general if you have a proxy.

Please check the **examples** package for inspiration.

This is a very simple HTTP Hello World:
```java
Stereotypes.auto().embeddedHttpServer(8080, new Stereotypes.HttpStringWorker("/", ex -> "Hello world!"));
```

Some warnings
==
Fibry is experimental, and to leverage its potential you need to use Loom, which is a project under development that it's not clear when it will be merged into the OpenJDK, though clearly the development is very active and proceeding well.
I suspect that Loom has some bugs, as I saw some errors popping up when exchanging sync messages between a thread and a fiber, so it might be better to not mix them for now.
If you start to use Fibry and find some bugs, please notify me.

Not every network operation is Fiber Friendly, at the moment. You can find a list [here](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/loom/Networking+IO). 
In particular UDP is only partly supported. Selectors are also not supported, but as avoiding non-blocking operation is a key goal of fibers, this should not be a concern.

At the moment I have no plans to make a distributed version of Fibry, but if there is real interest I would be happy to do it.

Enjoy!
